<h1 align="center">Code Challenges</h1>

<h3 align="center">Welcome to my special corner! ðŸ©·</h3>

<p align="center">
Here, I embrace challenges with care to learn and evolve. <br>
There's no sweeter feeling than realizing that, day after day, I give my best. <br>
So, let the coding adventure begin! âœ¨

<h3 align="center">Structure</h3>

<p align="center">
The repository is organized as follows: several folders are on the main page, and each of them is named after a specific programming language or technology. Within each folder, there are multiple subfolders, each containing a challenge implemented using the language or technology indicated in the name of the main folder.
</p>

<p align="center">
<strong>Example:</strong> If you are on the repository's main page and want to explore challenges implemented in Java, simply access the folder named <strong>"java"</strong>, where you will find several subfolders, each containing a different Java challenge.
